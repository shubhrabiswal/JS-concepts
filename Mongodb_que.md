### 1. What is “Namespace” in MongoDB?
For a collection or a view, the namespace includes the database name, the dot (.) separator, and the collection/view name (e.g. <database>.<collection>),
e.g. - db_name.collection_name
  
### 2. What is sharding in MongoDB?
Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.
Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications can challenge the capacity of a single server.
